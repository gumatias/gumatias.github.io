### 2021-01-03 12:20 How I created this blog

I spent the weekend overwhelmed with the amount of blogging options out there, and it wasn't the first time. I've attempted blogging before, and failed to my discontent... Was it lack of willpower, determination, focus or a goal oriented mindset? Maybe. One thing I know for sure is that the idea of blogging to me, has that senseof something well fleshed out, official and good looking for others to read.

Although I like that as an outcome and even aspiration, I would dread it sometimes because the standards I'd set to myself would be greater than I probably should.

I'm now approaching it with a journaling mentality. Where any time of the day, I can jot down my notes, thoughts and ideas without much pressure on how it should look or anything of that sort.

To start, I'm sharing the script I wrote that created this blog more or less automatically, it's a script called [one-step-to-journal](https://gist.github.com/gumatias/209da343a168c34320e1bb59d3508c60).
