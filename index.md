### 2021-01-03 12:20 How I created this blog

I spent the weekend overwhelmed with the amount of blogging options out there, and it wasn't the first time. I've attempted blogging before, and failed to my discontent... Was it lack of willpower, determination, focus or a goal oriented mindset? Maybe. One thing I know for sure is that the idea of blogging to me, has that senseof something well fleshed out, official and good looking for others to read.

Although I like that as an outcome and even aspiration, I would dread it sometimes because the standards I'd set to myself would be greater than I probably should.

I'm now approaching it with a journaling mentality. Where any time of the day, I can jot down my notes, thoughts and ideas without much pressure on how it should look or anything of that sort.

To start, I'm sharing the script I wrote that created this blog more or less automatically, it's a script called [one-step-to-journal](https://gist.github.com/gumatias/209da343a168c34320e1bb59d3508c60).
 
### 2021-01-03 22:16 First Time Open Sourcing in Python

I'm realizing today that one of the most purposeful and productive way to work, learn and grow is by tackling the problem that is right in front of me. For instance, I'm very hooked on this journaling idea and have been messing with Github Pages and jrnl over the past few days, and now I'm finding myself in need of a feature that jrnl [currently does not support](https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl/issues/821).

The problem seems simple, but the scope seems large: I'm unfamiliar with the internals of the tool, the programming language its been developed in and it's something I could easily ignore.

I decided not to, and instead, take this need as an opportunity to learn and tangentially contribute in a good way to a community I initially had no intentions to help. I started [very very small though](https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl/pull/1148), but I believe it's a solid first step.

We'll see where this goes.
